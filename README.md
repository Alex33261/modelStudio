## Overview

The `dime` package automates explanation of Machine Learning predictive models This package generates advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form
of serverless HTML site.

It combines **R** with **D3.js** to produce plots and descriptions
for local and global explanations. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,
so it also supports EDA on top of that. ModelStudio is a fast and condensed way to get
all the answers without much effort. Break down your model and look into its ingredients
with only a few lines of code.

The package `dime` is a part of the [DrWhy.AI](http://drwhy.ai) universe.

## Installation

```{r}
# the easiest way to get ingredients is to install it from CRAN:
install.packages("ingredients")

# Install the development version from GitHub:
# dependencies
devtools::install_github("ModelOriented/ingredients")
devtools::install_github("ModelOriented/iBreakDown")

# dime
devtools::install_github("ModelOriented/dime")
```

## Demo

This package bases on DALEX explainers created with `DALEX::explain()`.

```r
library("dime")
library("DALEX")
```

Create a model:

```r
titanic_small <- titanic_imputed[, c(1,2,3,6,7,9)]
titanic_small$survived <- titanic_small$survived == "yes"

model_titanic_glm <- glm(survived ~ gender + age + fare + class + sibsp,
                         data = titanic_small, family = "binomial")
```

Wrap it into an explainer:

```r
explain_titanic_glm <- explain(model_titanic_glm,
                               data = titanic_small[,-6],
                               y = titanic_small[,6],
                               label = "glm")
```

Pick some data points:

```r
new_observations <- titanic_small[1:4,]
rownames(new_observations) <- c("Lucas", "James", "Thomas", "Nancy")
```

Make a studio for the model:

```r
modelStudio(explain_titanic_glm, new_observations)
```

## Save

You can save `modelStudio` using controls on the top of the RStudio Viewer
or with `r2d3::save_d3_html()` and `r2d3::save_d3_png()`.
