This package generates advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form
of serverless HTML site.

It combines **R** with **D3.js** to produce plots and descriptions
for local and global explanations. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,
so it also supports EDA on top of that. ModelStudio is a fast and condensed way to get
all the answers without much effort. Break down your model and look into its ingredients
with only a few lines of code.

#### [See an example](https://modeloriented.github.io/dime/demo.html) &emsp; [It also works with **Python** scikit-learn, keras and more, thanks to DALEXtra](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEXtra)

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```
# dependencies
devtools::install_github("ModelOriented/ingredients")

## Demo

This package bases on `DALEX::explain()`.

```r
 library("dime")
 library("DALEX")
```

Create a model:

```r
 titanic <- na.omit(titanic)
 titanic_small <- titanic[, c(1,2,3,6,7,9)]

 model_titanic_glm <- glm(survived == "yes" ~ gender + age + fare + class + sibsp,
                          data = titanic_small, family = "binomial")
```

Wrap it into an explainer:

```r
 explain_titanic_glm <- explain(model_titanic_glm,
                                data = titanic_small[, -6],
                                y = titanic_small$survived == "yes",
                                label = "glm")
```

Pick some data points:

```r
 new_observations <- titanic_small[1:4, -6]
 rownames(new_observations) <- c("Lucas", "James", "Thomas", "Nancy")
```

Make a studio for the model:

```r
 modelStudio(explain_titanic_glm, new_observations, N = 100, B = 10)
```

## Save 

You can save `modelStudio` using controls on the top of the RStudio Viewer
or with `r2d3::save_d3_html()` and `r2d3::save_d3_png()`.
