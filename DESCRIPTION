Description: Automate explaining machine learning predictive models.
  This package generates advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form
  of serverless HTML site. It combines R with D3.js to produce plots and descriptions
  for local and global explanations. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,
  so it also supports EDA on top of that. ModelStudio is a fast and condensed way to get
  all the answers without much effort. Break down your model and look into its ingredients
  with only a few lines of code.  
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
